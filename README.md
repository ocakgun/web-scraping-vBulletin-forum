# web-scraping-forum-vBuletin
This repository includes a web scraper written in Python for self-development of a linguistic text corpus. It was designed for one specific German gaming forum (forum.pcgames.de) but the concept can be applied to other forums too.
The script has a built-in delay of average 1 second between two requests. This limit was defined in direct conversation with the operator of forum.pcgames.de
Code will follow until end of april 2019
